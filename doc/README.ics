SAL -> ICS interface
--------------------

ICS (Integrated Canonizer and Solver) is an efficient decision procedure for a
fragment of first-order equational logic. The ICS executable is part of the SAL 
distribution package. The full ICS distribution package can be downloaded 
from the following website:

http://ics.csl.sri.com/

Remark: SAL and ICS share the same license agreement.
Remark: ICS is included in the SAL distribution package.

ICS is used in the tools sal-bmc and sal-inf-bmc. ICS is also the default
decision procedure used by these tools. 

Example: Checks the property 'mutex' in the context 'inf-bakery' using ICS.

   % sal-inf-bmc -v 10 inf-bakery mutex

The default behavior of SAL is to look for an executable called `ics'. 
The command used to execute ICS can be changed using the statement:

(sal/set-ics-command! "<path-to-ics>/ics")

This statement should be included in your `.salrc' file in your home directory.
