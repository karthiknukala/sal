Tutorial:

   salenv_tutorial.pdf

Examples:
   The directory `examples' contains several SAL specifications.
   Each subdirectory contains a different example. A README
   file provides a short description of the example, and the 
   commands that can be used to perform verification/simulation.

Man Pages:
   The subdirectory `./man' contains man pages for the SAL tools.
   They can be copied to your MANPATH. You can also use man to
   access these files without installing them. For instance, to 
   access the sal-bmc.1, you should type:
 
   % man ./man/sal-bmc.1

   Remark: If this command does not work in your system, check
   your man documentation by typing:
   
   % man man

Limitations:
   SAL tools only support a subset of the SAL language. Please,
   read the file 'Limitations.txt'.

SAL tools command line options:
   Every SAL tool accepts the option --help. It provides a detailed
   description of the available command line options. For example,
   the following command describes the options available in sal-smc:

   % sal-smc --help
  
Additional Information:
   Additional information is available online on the SAL website:
 
   http://sal.csl.sri.com/

External tools:
   SAL can be connected to different tools. The files README.<tool-name>
   contains instructions regarding the connection with the tool '<tool-name>'.
   These tools are not part of the SAL distribution, and must be
   obtained separately from their respective authors.
