Mode confusion

Description: Automation surprises occur when an automated system behaves
differently than its operator expects. If the actual system behavior and the
operator's "mental model" are both described as finite state transition 
systems. Model checking can be used to discover any scenarios that cause
the behaviors of the two descriptions to diverge from one another.
These scenarios identify potential surprises and pin point areas where
design changes, or revisions to training materials or procedures, should
be considered.
