Stack

This example was extracted from the UCLID manual. 
UCLID is available online at: http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~uclid/
A stack of arbitrary length can be modeled using two components:
`top', `contents'. Conceptually, the contents of the stack
is represented as a subsequence of an infinite sequence. The
component `contents' is the infinite sequence, and it is modeled
as an infinite array of data. `top' is an index
(natural number) to the next available position on the stack.

The module S specifies the stack using LSAL syntax. It has two
input variables: `op' and `data'. `op' specifies the operation
to be performed on the stack (push, pop, or noop). `data' contains
the information to be pushed on the stack, when `op' is equals to
`push'. The operations are modeled in the following way:

1-	push:
  update `contents' at position `top' with the current `data',
  and increment `top'
2-  pop:
  decrement `top' when top > 0
3-  noop:
  do nothing

The ouput variable `first' always contains the value on the top of the
stack. If the stack is empty, then the value is undefined.
The output variable `invalid_pop' is true when the a pop operation
is performed over an empty stack.

The module `test-bench1' specifies a little test for the S module.
It basically performs three pushes, followed by three pops. The property
`th1' states the the elements are poped in the correct order. The module
`test-bench1' uses an array to record the output `first' produced 
by the S module in every step.
The property `th2' checks whether `invalid_pop' is always false or not.

Commands:

- Check the stack property

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 6 --enable-ate stack th1

  Remark: we have to use the flag --enable-ate (array theory elimination),
  because the array theory in ICS is incomplete.

- Check the stack property using UCLID

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 6 -s uclid stack th1

  Remark: you must have UCLID installed in your system to use this 
  command.

- Check consistency property

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 6 --enable-ate stack th2

- Generate counterexample for invalid property

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 6 --enable-ate stack invalid
