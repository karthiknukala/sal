Bakery Protocol (unbounded version)
-----------------------------------

Description: The basic idea is that of a bakery, where customers (jobs) take numbers,
             and whoever has the lowest number gets service next. Here, of course,
             ``service'' means entry to the critical section. The file `inf-bakery.lsal'
             models the protocol for two processes. 

Commands:

- Check if the property mutex is violated in the first 10 steps

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 inf-bakery mutex

- Generate a counterexample for the invalid property

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 inf-bakery invalid

- Prove property aux1 using 1-induction

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 1 -i inf-bakery aux1

- Prove property aux2 using 1-induction

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 1 -i inf-bakery aux2

- Prove property mutex using 3-induction and lemmas aux1 and aux2

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 3 -l aux1 -l aux2 -i inf-bakery mutex

- Prove property mutex using 7-induction

  % sal-inf-bmc -v 3 -d 7 -i inf-bakery mutex
