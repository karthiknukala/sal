Distributed Mutual Exclusion
----------------------------

This example is based on the file dme.smv found
in the SMV distribution package. This example
was encoded using the SAL lisp-like input language.

Commands:

- Prove the property mutex for 3 cells 

  % sal-smc -v 3 --assertion='dme{;3}!mutex'

- Prove the property mutex for 5 cells 

  % sal-smc -v 3 --assertion='dme{;5}!mutex'
