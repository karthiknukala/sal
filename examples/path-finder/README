Description:
Models the Pathfinder scheduling algorithm and explains the
cause of the recurring reset problem during the mission on Mars
there is a high priority process, that consumes data produced by
a low priority process. Data consumption and production happens under
the protection of a mutex lock the mutex lock conflicts with the
scheduling priorities which can deadlock the system if
high_priority_process starts up while low_priority_process has the lock set

Commands

- Detect deadlock states

  % sal-deadlock-checker -v 3 pathfinder system
