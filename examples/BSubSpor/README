BSubSpor78.sal --- HybridSAL specification of B.Subtilis Sporulation Initiation Network.
BSubSpor78ABS.sal --- SAL specification of the abstraction of the above.
	It is automatically generated from the BSubSpor78.sal HybridSal specification 
	using the HybridAbstractor. Invariants AND properties were added by hand. 

	The goal is to prove that the BSub Sporulation network stabilizes in a High Spo0AP and
	low SinR4 state (when environmental conditions are not conducive to growth).
	We prove that whenever the bacteria reaches the "HIGH Spo0AP AND LOW SinR4" state 
	*after* certain other protein concentrations have stopped fluctuating, then it continues
	to remain in this state.

sporulate2 --- stability property, as described above. Of the form G(p => Gp).
sporulate1 --- the stable state is reached (note this is weaker. It doesn't say it is
*always eventually* reached.

How to test?
------------
 % sal-smc -v 3 BSubSpor78ABS sporulate1
	  Will produce a counter-example, which shows that the stable region is reachable.

 % sal-smc -v 3 BSubSpor78ABS sporulate2
  	Will prove the above stability property.
